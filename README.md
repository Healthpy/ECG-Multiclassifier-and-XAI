# ECG-Multiclassifier-and-XAI
Interpretable AI models to identify cardiac arrhythmias and explainability in ShAP.

## TODOs
1. Explainability in SHAP based on Zhang et al. paper
2. Build a new classifier for cardiac arrhythmias that use only the HRV features. Suggestion for ML classifier : Logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, multilayer perceptron, support vector machines etc.
3. Check classification performance and explainability of the classifiers
4. Build a joint classifier that merge the raw ECG signal and the HRV features
5. Check classification performance of the three classifier developed so far.
6. Explore the explainability of the classifier developed above
7. Explore feasibility to transfer the workflow to the POLIMI work.
