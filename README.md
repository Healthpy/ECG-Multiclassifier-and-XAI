# ECG-Multiclassifier-and-XAI
Interpretable AI models to identify cardiac arrhythmias and explainability in ShAP.

## TODOs
Explainability in SHAP based on Zhang et al. paper
Build a new classifier for cardiac arrhythmias that use only the HRV features.
Suggestion for ML classifier : Logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, multilayer perceptron, support vector machines etc
Check classification performance and explainability of the classifiers
Build a joint classifier that merge the raw ECG signal and the HRV features
Check classification performance of the three classifier developed so far.
Explore the explainability of the classifier developed above
Explore feasibility to transfer the workflow to the POLIMI work.
